# Getting Started

To start the workshop, follow one of the following depending on whether you are...

* ...[attending an AWS hosted event](aws_event/), or
* ...[running the workshop on your own](self_paced/)

Once you have completed with either setup, continue with [**Create a SSH key section**](/prerequisites/sshkey/)
