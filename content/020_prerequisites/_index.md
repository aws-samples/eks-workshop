# Getting Started
To start the workshop, follow one of the following depending on whether you are...

* ...[running the workshop on your own (in your own account)](self_paced/), or
* ...[attending an AWS hosted event (using AWS provided hashes)](aws_event/)

Once you have completed with either setup, continue with [**Create a Workspace**](/prerequisites/workspace/)
