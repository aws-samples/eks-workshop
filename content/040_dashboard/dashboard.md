The official Kubernetes dashboard is not deployed by default, but there are
instructions in [the official documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/web-ui-dashboard/)

We can deploy the dashboard with the following command:
```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/v1.10.1/src/deploy/recommended/kubernetes-dashboard.yaml
```

Since this is deployed to our private cluster, we need to access it via a proxy.
Kube-proxy is available to proxy our requests to the dashboard service.  In your
workspace, run the following command:
```
kubectl proxy --port=8080 --address='0.0.0.0' --disable-filter=true &
```

This will start the proxy, listen on port 8080, listen on all interfaces, and
will disable the filtering of non-localhost requests.

This command will continue to run in the background of the current terminal's session.

{{% notice warning %}}
We are disabling request filtering, a security feature that guards against XSRF attacks.
This isn't recommended for a production environment, but is useful for our dev environment.
