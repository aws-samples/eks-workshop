Next, we'll setup the workers to have the correct permissions to run App Mesh API calls.

Verify that $ROLE_NAME is defined by running the following command:

```
echo $ROLE_NAME
```

If this variable is not defined (the above command returns an empty value), please visit [the cluster test chapter](../../../eksctl/test) and run through the export role name step.

Also be sure you have your region defined.  Verify its set by running the following command:

```
echo $AWS_REGION
```

If this variable is not defined (the above command returns an empty value), please run the following to define the AWS_REGION environmental variable:

```
export ACCOUNT_ID=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --output text --query Account)
export AWS_REGION=$(curl -s 169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/document | jq -r '.region')

echo "export ACCOUNT_ID=${ACCOUNT_ID}" >> ~/.bash_profile
echo "export AWS_REGION=${AWS_REGION}" >> ~/.bash_profile
aws configure set default.region ${AWS_REGION}
aws configure get default.region
```



Copy and paste the below code to add the permissions as an inline policy to your worker node instances:

aws iam put-role-policy --role-name $ROLE_NAME --policy-name AM-Policy-For-Worker --policy-document file://k8s-appmesh-worker-policy.json
```

To verify the policy was attached to the role, run the following command:

```
aws iam get-role-policy --role-name $ROLE_NAME --policy-name AM-Policy-For-Worker
```
