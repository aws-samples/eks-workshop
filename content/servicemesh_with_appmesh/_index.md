### Service Mesh With AWS App Mesh

A service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer for handling **service-to-service communication**.

AWS App Mesh is a service mesh based on the Envoy proxy that makes it easy to monitor and control containerized microservices. App Mesh standardizes how your microservices communicate, giving you end-to-end visibility and helping to ensure high-availability for your applications.

App Mesh gives you consistent visibility and network traffic controls for every microservice in an application. You can use App Mesh with Amazon ECS (using the Amazon EC2 launch type), Amazon EKS, and Kubernetes on AWS.

App Mesh is currently in Public Preview.  In addition to this workshop module, you can [visit the official AWS App Mesh page](https://aws.amazon.com/app-mesh/).

The content of this chapter was based on work found at https://github.com/awslabs/aws-app-mesh-examples.  Be sure to check that repo often for the latest App Mesh demos.
