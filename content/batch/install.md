### Install Argo CLI

Before we can get started configuring `argo` we'll need to first install the
command line tools that you will interact with. To do this run the following.

```
sudo curl -sSL -o /usr/local/bin/argo https://github.com/argoproj/argo/releases/download/v2.2.1/argo-linux-amd64
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/argo
```
