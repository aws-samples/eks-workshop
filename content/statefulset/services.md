#### Introduction
[Kubernetes Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them. Service can be exposed in different ways by specifying a [type](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/expose/expose-intro/) in the serviceSpec. StatefulSet currently requires a [Headless Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#headless-services) to control the domain of its Pods, directly reach each Pod with stable DNS entries. By specifying **"None"** for the clusterIP, you can create Headless Service.
#### Create Services
Copy/Paste the following commands into your Cloud9 Terminal.
```
cd ~/environment/templates
wget https://eksworkshop.com/statefulset/services.files/mysql-services.yml
```
Check the configuration of mysql-services.yml by following command.
```
cat ~/environment/templates/mysql-services.yml
```
You can see the **mysql** service is for DNS resolution so that when pods are placed by StatefulSet controller, pods can be resolved using pod-name.mysql. **mysql-read** is a client service that does load balancing for all slaves. 
```
# Headless service for stable DNS entries of StatefulSet members.
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql
  labels:
    app: mysql
spec:
  ports:
  - name: mysql
    port: 3306
  clusterIP: None
  selector:
    app: mysql
---
# Client service for connecting to any MySQL instance for reads.
# For writes, you must instead connect to the master: mysql-0.mysql.
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql-read
  labels:
    app: mysql
spec:
  ports:
  - name: mysql
    port: 3306
  selector:
    app: mysql
```
Create service mysql and mysql-read by following command
```
kubectl create -f ~/environment/templates/mysql-services.yml
```
