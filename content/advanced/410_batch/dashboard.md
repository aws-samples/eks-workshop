### Argo Dashboard

{{% notice info %}}
Since V2.5, Argo UI has been replace by Argo Server. The new UI is not read-only â€” it also comes with the ability to create and update data directly in your browser. [Click here for more information](https://blog.argoproj.io/argo-workflows-v2-5-released-ce7553bfd84c)

#### Access the Argo Server

To access the dashboard we will expose the argo-server service by adding a LoadBalancer.

```bash
kubectl -n argo patch svc argo-server  \
   -p '{"spec": {"type": "LoadBalancer"}}'
```

{{% notice info %}}
It will take several minutes for the ELB to become healthy and start passing traffic to the  pods.

To access the Argo Dashboard, click on the URL generated by the these commands:

```bash
ARGO_URL=$(kubectl -n argo get svc argo-server --template "{{ range (index .status.loadBalancer.ingress 0) }}{{ . }}{{ end }}")

echo ARGO DASHBOARD: http://${ARGO_URL}:2746
```

You will see the `teardrop` workflow from [Advanced Batch Workflow](/advanced/410_batch/workflow-advanced/). Click on it to see a visualization of the workflow.

The workflow should _relatively_ look like a teardrop, and provide a live status for each job. Click on **Hotel** to see a summary of the Hotel job.

This details basic information about the job, and includes a link to the Logs. The Hotel job logs list the job dependency chain and the current `whalesay`, and should look similar to:

Explore the other jobs in the workflow to see each job's status and logs.
