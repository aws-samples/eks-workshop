#### Deploy the Frontend Service

Since we want to visualize the automated canary deployment, we need an UI for which, we will use `frontend` service. This `frontend` service will call the backend service `detail` to get the vendor information. In order to expose the `frontend` service outside the mesh we will use AWS AppMesh VirtualGateway affiliated with Network Load Balancer. Lets deploy the `frontend` service.

```bash
export APP_VERSION=1.0
envsubst < flagger/frontend.yaml | kubectl apply -f - 
```

{{< output >}}
deployment.apps/frontend created
service/frontend created
virtualnode.appmesh.k8s.aws/frontend created
virtualservice.appmesh.k8s.aws/frontend created 
{{< /output >}}

#### Deploy the AppMesh VirtualGateway

```bash
helm upgrade -i appmesh-gateway eks/appmesh-gateway \
	--namespace flagger \
    --set serviceAccount.create=false \
    --set serviceAccount.name=flagger-envoy-proxies
```

NOTES:
AWS App Mesh Gateway installed!

#### Create the GatewayRoute

In this [GatewayRoute](https://github.com/aws-containers/eks-microservice-demo/blob/main/flagger/gateway.yaml), we are routing the traffic coming into the VirtualGateway to `frontend` VirtualService.

```bash
kubectl apply -f flagger/gateway.yaml 
```

Get all the resources for AppMesh VirtualGateway `appmesh-gateway`

```bash
kubectl get all  -n flagger -o wide | grep appmesh-gateway
```

{{% notice info %}}
It takes 3 to 5 minutes to set up the Load Balancer.

#### Testing Setup

Find the AppMesh VirtualGateway public endpoint:

```bash
export URL="http://$(kubectl -n flagger get svc/appmesh-gateway -ojson | jq -r ".status.loadBalancer.ingress[].hostname")"
echo $URL
```

{{< output >}}  
http://a21cab1223ac9414da4c97dee2f2c245-XXXXXXXX.elb.us-east-2.amazonaws.com
{{< /output >}}

Wait for the NLB to become active:

```bash
watch curl -sS $URL
```

Once the LoadBalancer is active, access the LoadBalancer endpoint in browser

You can see that our `frontend` service is exposed via VirtualGateway using Network LoadBalancer. And this `frontend` service communicates with backend service `detail` to get the vendor information.

Congratulations on exposing the `frontend` service via App Mesh VirtualGateway!  

Letâ€™s test the Automated Canary Deployment for `detail` backend service.
