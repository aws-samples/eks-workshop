To run this workshop on a local machine, you should have the following prerequisites:

* Python 3.6 or later.

* The AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) version 1. For Windows, use the MSI
installer. For Linux, macOS, or Unix, use the bundled installer.

* The AWS CLI is configured to communicate with services in your deployment account.
Otherwise, either set your profile by **EXPORT AWS_PROFILE=<your_aws_profile>**
or run **aws configure** to set up your AWS account access.

If you donâ€™t want to install tools on your computer, use [AWS CloudShell](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/home), a browser-
based shell that makes it easy to run scripts with the AWS CLI.
