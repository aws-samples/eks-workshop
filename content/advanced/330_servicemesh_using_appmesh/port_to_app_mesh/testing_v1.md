Now it's time to test. 
![App Mesh](/images/app_mesh_fargate/meshify.png)

To test if our ported Product Catalog App is working as expected, we'll first exec into the `frontend-node` container.

```bash
export FE_POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -n prodcatalog-ns -l app=frontend-node -o jsonpath='{.items[].metadata.name}') 

kubectl -n prodcatalog-ns exec -it ${FE_POD_NAME} -c frontend-node bash
```

You will see a prompt from within the `frontend-node` container.

{{< output >}}
root@frontend-node-9d46cb55-XXX:/usr/src/app#
{{< /output >}}

Test the confiuration by issuing a curl request to the virtual service `prodcatalog` on port 5000, simulating what would happen if code running in the same pod made a request to the `prodcatalog` backend:

```bash
curl -v http://prodcatalog.prodcatalog-ns.svc.cluster.local:5000/products/    
```

Output should be similar to below. You can see that the request to backend service `prodcatalog` is going via envoy proxy.

Exit from the `frontend-node` exec bash.
Now, To test the connectivity from Fargate service `prodcatalog` to Nodegroup service `proddetail`, we'll first exec into the `prodcatalog` container.

```bash
export BE_POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -n prodcatalog-ns -l app=prodcatalog -o jsonpath='{.items[].metadata.name}') 

kubectl -n prodcatalog-ns exec -it ${BE_POD_NAME} -c prodcatalog bash
```
You will see a prompt from within the `prodcatalog` container.

{{< output >}}
root@prodcatalog-98f7c5f87-xxxxx:/usr/src/app#
{{< /output >}}

Test the confiuration by issuing a curl request to the virtual service proddetail on port 3000, simulating what would happen if code running in the same pod made a request to the proddetail backend:

```bash
curl -v http://proddetail.prodcatalog-ns.svc.cluster.local:3000/catalogDetail 
```

You should see the below response. You can see that the request to backend service `proddetail-v1` is going via envoy proxy. You can exit now from the `prodcatalog` exec bash.

Congrats! You've migrated the initial architecture to provide the same functionality. Now lets expose the frontend-node to external users to access the UI using App Mesh Virtual Gateway.
