Now it's time to test. Get the Loadbalancer endpoint that Virtual Gateway is exposed.
    
{{% notice info %}}
It takes 3 to 5 minutes to set up the Load Balancer. You can go to Console and Go to Load Balancer and check if the state is `Active`.
Do not proceed to next step until Load Balancer is `Active`.
{{% /notice %}}

```bash
export LB_NAME=$(kubectl get svc ingress-gw -n prodcatalog-ns -o jsonpath="{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[*].hostname}") 
 curl -v --silent ${LB_NAME} | grep x-envoy
echo $LB_NAME
```
Check if the request to the Ingress Gateway is going from envoy by curl to the above Loadbalancer url

Copy paste the above Loadbalancer endpoint in your browser and you should see the frontend application loaded as below.

Add Product e.g. `Table` with ID as `1` to Product Catalog and click **Add** button.
![post rquest](/images/app_mesh_fargate/ui2.png)

You should see the new product `Table` added in the Product Catalog table. You can also see the Catalog Detail about Vendor information has been fetched from `proddetail` backend service.

Congratulations on exposing the Product Catalog Application via App Mesh Virtual Gateway!  

Letâ€™s try out Canary Deployment by adding a new version of the `proddetail-v2` and adding some new configuration to our virtual routers to shift traffic between the different versions of Catalog Detail service `proddetail-v1` and `proddetail-v2`.
