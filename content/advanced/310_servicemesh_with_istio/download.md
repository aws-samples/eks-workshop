Before we can get started configuring Istio weâ€™ll need to first install the command line tools that you will interact with. To do this run the following.

{{% notice info %}}
We will use istio version `1.10.0`
{{% /notice %}}

```bash
echo 'export ISTIO_VERSION="1.10.0"' >> ${HOME}/.bash_profile
source ${HOME}/.bash_profile
```

```bash
cd ~/environment
curl -L https://istio.io/downloadIstio | ISTIO_VERSION=${ISTIO_VERSION} sh -
```

The installation directory contains:

* Installation YAML files for Kubernetes in install/kubernetes
* Sample applications in `samples/`
* The `istioctl` client binary in the `bin/` directory (`istioctl` is used when manually injecting Envoy as a sidecar proxy).

```bash
cd ${HOME}/environment/istio-${ISTIO_VERSION}

sudo cp -v bin/istioctl /usr/local/bin/
```

We can verify that we have the proper version in our $PATH

```bash
istioctl version --remote=false
```
