Now that we have a good understanding of the load, let's explore the logs generated by WordPress and sent to Cloudwatch by the _Fluentd_ agent.

From the CloudWatch Container Insights browser tab:

* Scroll down to the _Pod performance_ section.
* Select the WordPress pod.
* Select _application logs_ from the _Action_ menu.

The last action will open the _CloudWatch Logs Insights_ UI in another tab.

Click the _Run query_ button and  expand one of log line to look at it.

_Fluentd_ has split the JSON files into multiple fields that could be easily parsed for debugging or to be included into Custom Application Dashboard.
