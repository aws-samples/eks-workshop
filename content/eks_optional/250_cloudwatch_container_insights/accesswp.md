### Testing public URL

{{% notice warning %}}
It may take a few minutes for the LoadBalancer to be available.
{{% /notice %}}

Youâ€™ll need the URL for your WordPress site. This is easily accomplished by running the command below from your terminal window.

```bash
export SERVICE_URL=$(kubectl get svc -n wordpress-cwi understood-zebu-wordpress --template "{{ range (index .status.loadBalancer.ingress 0) }}{{.}}{{ end }}")

echo "Public URL: http://$SERVICE_URL/"
```

You should see the _Hello World_ WordPress welcome page.

### Testing the admin interface

```bash
export ADMIN_URL="http://$SERVICE_URL/admin"
export ADMIN_PASSWORD=$(kubectl get secret --namespace wordpress-cwi understood-zebu-wordpress -o jsonpath="{.data.wordpress-password}" | base64 --decode)

echo "Admin URL: http://$SERVICE_URL/admin
Username: user
Password: $ADMIN_PASSWORD
"
```

In your favorite browser paste in your Wordpress Admin URL from the Installing Wordpress section. You should be greeted with the following screen.

Enter your username and password to make sure they work.

If you are taken to the below screen, you have a successfully running Wordpress install backed by MaiaDB in your EKS Cluster.

Now that we have verified that the site is working we can continue with getting CloudWatch Container Insights installed on our cluster!
