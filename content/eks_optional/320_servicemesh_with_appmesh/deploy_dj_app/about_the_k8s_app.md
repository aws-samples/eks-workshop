## Architecture

The example app we'll walk you through creating on App Mesh is called `DJ` and is used for a cloud-based music service.

This application is composed of three microservices:

* dj
* metal-v1
* jazz-v1

The `dj` service makes requests to either the `jazz-v1` or `metal-v1` backends for artist lists:

* Requests made to the `jazz-v1` backend may return artists such as _Miles Davis_ or _Astrud Gilberto_.
* Requests made to the `metal-v1` backend may return artists such as _Judas Priest_ or _Megadeth_.

## Challenge

Today, `dj` is hardwired to make requests to `metal-v1` and `jazz-v1`.

Each time there is a new `metal` or `jazz` release, we also need to release a new version of `dj` as to point to its new version-specific endpoints. It works, but it's not an optimal configuration to maintain for the long term.  

## Solution

We're going to demonstrate how `AWS App Mesh` can be used to simplify this architecture; by virtualizing the `metal` and `jazz` services, we can add dynamic configuration and route traffic to the versioned endpoints of our choosing, minimizing the need for complete re-deployment of the `dj` service each time there is a new `metal` or `jazz` service release.  

When we're done, our app will look more like the following:
