#### Use the dry-run flag to test our templates

To test the syntax and validity of the Chart without actually deploying it, we'll use the dry-run flag.

The following command will build and output the rendered templates without installing the Chart:

```sh
helm install --debug --dry-run --name workshop ~/environment/eksdemo
```
Confirm that the values created by the template look correct.


#### Deploy the chart
Now that we have tested our template, lets install it.

```
helm install --name workshop ~/environment/eksdemo
```

Similar to what we saw previously in the [NGINX Helm Chart example](../helm_nginx), an output of the Deployment, Pod, and Service objects are output, similar to:

```
