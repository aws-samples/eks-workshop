To test the service our eksdemo Chart created, we'll need to get the name of the ELB endpoint that was generated when we deployed the Chart:

```
kubectl get svc ecsdemo-frontend -o jsonpath="{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[*].hostname}"; echo
```

Copy that address, and paste it into a new tab in your browser.  You should see something similar to:
