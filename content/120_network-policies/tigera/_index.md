In this module, we will use Tigera's [Secure Cloud Edition](https://www.tigera.io/tigera-secure-ce) to extend Kubernetes network policies to EKS' VPC security groups and surfacing enhanced flow logs for Kubernetes workloads in CloudWatch."

We are assuming that you are doing this within the Cloud9 environment that you used to initially setup the cluster, and are using the Cloud9 CLI shell.  If not, please adjust these instructions to your environment.
