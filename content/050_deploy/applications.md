```
In the sample file above, we describe the service and  *how* it should be deployed.
We will write this description to the kubernetes api using kubectl, and kubernetes
will ensure our preferences are met as the application is deployed.

The containers listen on port 3000, and native service discovery will be used
to locate the running containers and communicate with them.
