### Kubeflow Pipelines

Kubeflow Pipeline is one the core components of the toolkit and gets deployed automatically when you install Kubeflow. Kubeflow Pipelines consists of:
- A user interface (UI) for managing and tracking experiments, jobs, and runs.
- An engine for scheduling multi-step ML workflows.
- An SDK for defining and manipulating pipelines and components.
- Notebooks for interacting with the system using the SDK.

Amazon Sagemaker is a managed service that enables data scientists and developers to quickly and easily build, train, and deploy machine learning models.

For this exercise, we will build Mnist classification pipeline using Amazon Sagemaker. Go to your notebook server
