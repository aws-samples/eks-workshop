# Machine Learning using [Kubeflow](https://kubeflow.org/)

[Kubeflow](https://kubeflow.org) provides a simple, portable, and scalable way of running Machine Learning workloas on Kubernetes.

In this module, we will install Kubeflow on Amazon EKS, run a single-node training and inference using [TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org/), and run distributed node training using [Horovod](https://github.com/horovod/horovod).
