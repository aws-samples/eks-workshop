Let's start by downloading the _fluentbit.yaml_ deployment file and replace some variables.

```bash
cd ~/environment/logging

# get the Amazon OpenSearch Endpoint
export ES_ENDPOINT=$(aws es describe-elasticsearch-domain --domain-name ${ES_DOMAIN_NAME} --output text --query "DomainStatus.Endpoint")

curl -Ss https://www.eksworkshop.com/intermediate/230_logging/deploy.files/fluentbit.yaml \
    | envsubst > ~/environment/logging/fluentbit.yaml
```

Explore the file to see what will be deployed. The fluent bit log agent configuration is located in the Kubernetes `ConfigMap` and will be deployed as a `DaemonSet`, i.e. one pod per worker node. In our case, a 3 node cluster is used and so 3 pods will be shown in the output when we deploy.

```bash
kubectl apply -f ~/environment/logging/fluentbit.yaml
```

Wait for all of the pods to change to running status

```bash
kubectl --namespace=logging get pods
```
