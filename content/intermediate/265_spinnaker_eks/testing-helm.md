#### Test Deployment

##### Push new container image to ECR for testing trigger

To ensure that the ECR trigger will work in Spinnaker UI:

- First change the content of the file to generate a new docker image digest. ECR trigger in Spinnaker does not work for same docker image digest. Go to `~/environment/eks-microservice-demo/apps/detail/app.js` and add a comment to first line of the file like below
```
// commenting for file for docker image generation
```

{{% notice info %}}
Ensure that the image tag (APP_VERSION) you are adding below does not exist in the ECR repository `eks-microservice-demo/test` otherwise the trigger will not work. Spinnaker pipeline only triggers when a new version of image is added to ECR.
{{% /notice %}}

And then run the below command in Cloud9 terminal.

```
cd ~/environment/eks-microservice-demo
aws ecr get-login-password --region $AWS_REGION | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin $ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com
export APP_VERSION=1.0
export ECR_REPOSITORY=eks-microservice-demo/test
TARGET=$ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com/$ECR_REPOSITORY:$APP_VERSION
docker build -t $TARGET apps/detail --no-cache
docker push $TARGET

```

{{% notice info %}} 
Building/Pushing Container images first time to ECR may take around 3-5 minutes
