title: "Add EKS Account"

At a high level, Spinnaker operates in the following way when deploying to Kubernetes:

- Spinnaker is configured with one or more “Cloud Provider” Kubernetes accounts (which you can think of as deployment targets)
- For each Kubernetes account, Spinnaker is provided a kubeconfig to connect to that Kubernetes cluster
- The kubeconfig should have the following contents:
  - A Kubernetes kubeconfig cluster
  - A Kubernetes kubeconfig user
  - A Kubernetes kubeconfig context
  - Metadata such as which context to use by default
- Each Kubernetes account is configured in the SpinnakerService manifest under spec.spinnakerConfig.config.providers.kubernetes.accounts key. Each entity has these (and other) fields:
  - name: A Spinnaker-internal name
  - kubeconfigFile: A file path referencing the contents of the kubeconfig file for connecting to the target cluster.
  - onlySpinnakerManaged: When true, Spinnaker only caches and displays applications that have been created by Spinnaker. 
  - namespaces: An array of namespaces that Spinnaker will be allowed to deploy to. If this is left blank, Spinnaker will be allowed to deploy to all namespaces
  - omitNamespaces: If namespaces is left blank, you can blacklist specific namespaces to indicate to Spinnaker that it should not deploy to those namespaces
- If the kubeconfig is properly referenced and available, Operator will take care of the following:
  - Creating a Kubernetes secret containing your kubeconfig in the namespace where Spinnaker lives
  - Dynamically generating a clouddriver.yml file that properly references the kubeconfig from where it is mounted within the Clouddriver container
  - Creating/Updating the Kubernetes Deployment (spin-clouddriver) which runs Clouddriver so that it is aware of the secret and properly mounts it in the Clouddriver pod

Now, lets add a Kubernetes/EKS Account Deployment Target in Spinnaker.

#### Download the latest spinnaker-tools release

This tool helps to create the ServiceAccount, ClusterRoleBinding, kubeconfig for the service account for the EKS/Kubernetes account
```
cd ~/environment
git clone https://github.com/armory/spinnaker-tools.git
cd spinnaker-tools
go mod download all
go build
```

#### Setup environment variables

  ```sh
  export CONTEXT=$(kubectl config current-context)
  export SOURCE_KUBECONFIG=${HOME}/.kube/config
  export SPINNAKER_NAMESPACE="spinnaker"
  export SPINNAKER_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME="spinnaker-ws-sa"
  export DEST_KUBECONFIG=${HOME}/Kubeconfig-ws-sa

  echo $CONTEXT
  echo $SOURCE_KUBECONFIG
  echo $SPINNAKER_NAMESPACE
  echo $SPINNAKER_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME
  echo $DEST_KUBECONFIG
  ```

{{% notice info %}}
If you do not see output from the above command for all the above Environment Variables, do not proceed to next step
{{% /notice %}}


#### Create the service account

Create the kubernetes service account with namespace-specific permissions

```
./spinnaker-tools create-service-account   --kubeconfig ${SOURCE_KUBECONFIG}   --context ${CONTEXT}   --output ${DEST_KUBECONFIG}   --namespace ${SPINNAKER_NAMESPACE}   --service-account-name ${SPINNAKER_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME}

#### Configure EKS Account


Open the `SpinnakerService` manifest located under `deploy/spinnaker/basic/spinnakerservice.yml`, then add the below to the section `spec.spinnakerConfig.config`.

  {{< output >}}
        providers:
            dockerRegistry:
              enabled: true
            kubernetes:
              enabled: true
              accounts:
              - name: spinnaker-workshop
                requiredGroupMembership: []
                providerVersion: V2
                permissions:
                dockerRegistries:
                  - accountName: my-ecr-registry
                configureImagePullSecrets: true
                cacheThreads: 1
                namespaces: [spinnaker,detail]
                omitNamespaces: []
                kinds: []
                omitKinds: []

                onlySpinnakerManaged: false
                kubeconfigFile: kubeconfig-sp  # File name must match "files" key
              primaryAccount: spinnaker-workshop  # Change to a desired account from the accounts array
   {{< /output >}}


Open the `SpinnakerService` manifest located under `deploy/spinnaker/basic/spinnakerservice.yml`, then add the below section under `spec.spinnakerConfig`. Replace the `<FILE CONTENTS HERE>` in below section with kubeconfig file content created from [previous step](/265_spinnaker_eks/add_eks-cccount/#create-the-service-account) from the location ${HOME}/Kubeconfig-ws-sa. 

  {{< output >}}
    files: 
        kubeconfig-sp: |
           <FILE CONTENTS HERE> # Content from kubeconfig created by Spinnaker Tool
   {{< /output >}}

Congratulations! You are done with the Spinnaker configuration for all the Spinnaker services! Lets install Spinnaker now.
