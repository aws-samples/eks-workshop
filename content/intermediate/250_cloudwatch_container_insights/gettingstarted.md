After you've completed the prerequisites and Helm is installed and working; We can deploy our Wordpress site.  This Helm chart will deploy MariaDB and Wordpress as well as configure a service ingress point for us to access the site through an elastic load balancer.

For our testing weâ€™ll be deploying Wordpress. We could just use a PHP file on the nodes and run NGINX to test as well, but with this Wordpress install you get experience deploying a Helm chart. And can use the load testing tool to hit various URLs on the Wordpress structure to generate additional network traffic load with multiple concurrent connections.

#### We'll be using the following tools in this lab:

- **Helm**: to install Wordpress on our cluster.
- **CloudWatch Container Insights**: to collect logs and metrics from our cluster.
- **Siege**: to load test our Wordpress and EKS Cluster.
- **CloudWatch Container Insights Dashboard**: to visualize our container performance and load.
- **CloudWatch Metrics**: to set an alarm for when our WordPress Pod is under heavy load.

### Lets get started!
