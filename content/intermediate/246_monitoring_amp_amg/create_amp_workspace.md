## Create a new AMP workspace

Go to the [AMP console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/prometheus/) and type-in a name for the AMP workspace and click on `Create`

Alternatively, you can also use AWS CLI to create the workspace using the following command:
```
aws amp create-workspace --alias eks-workshop --region $AWS_REGION
```

The AMP workspace should be created in just a few seconds. Once created, you will be able to see the workspace as shown below:
