Pixie automatically traces the full request/response bodies of application w for the following [supported protocols](https://docs.pixielabs.ai/about-pixie/observability/). Let’s use Pixie to see the contents of this failed HTTP request.

### Inspect the HTTP Request

Select the `px/http_data` script from the script drop-down menu. Change the `start_time` to `-30m` or any window that will include when you [triggered the bug](/intermediate/241_pixie/prereqs/#trigger-the-microservices-application-bug) in the Sock Shop app.

This script shows the traced HTTP1/2 requests made within your cluster, as long as the request either originates or is received inside of your cluster. There is quite a bit of HTTP traffic in this cluster, so let’s filter it to only show errors.

Open the script editor using `ctrl+e` (Windows, Linux) or `cmd+e` (Mac). Or by clicking on the edit script button circled in red below.

Delete line 29 and replace it with the following.

```bash
    # Access the service name.
    df.service = df.ctx['service']

    # Filter to only catalogue service.
    df = df[df.service == 'px-sock-shop/catalogue']

    # Filter to errors greater or equal to 400.
    df = df[df.resp_status >= 400]
```

{{% notice info %}}
Make sure that the new lines just added match the indentation of the existing lines. If not, you will get an `invalid syntax` error when running the script.
{{% /notice %}}

This code accesses the service of the pod receiving HTTP request. Then, it filters the requests to only include those made by the `catalogue` service that have an error code.

{{% notice info %}}
Pixie specifies services and pods with the namespace prepended. For example, the `catalogue` service in the `px-sock-shop` namespace looks like `px-sock-shop/catalogue`.
{{% /notice %}}

Re-run the script with the `RUN` button (top right of the page), or using the keyboard shortcut: `ctrl+enter` (Windows, Linux) or `cmd+enter` (Mac).

Hide the script editor using the same command to show it: `ctrl+e` (Windows, Linux) or `cmd+e` (Mac).

The output shows the request with the error you recently triggered. Click on a row to inspect the row data in json format. Scroll down to the `resp_body` json key and you can see that our error is a `database connection error`.
