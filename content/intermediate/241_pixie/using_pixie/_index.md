The Pixie platform uses PxL scripts to both:

- Query telemetry data collected by the Pixie Platform (DNS events, HTTP events, etc).
- Extend Pixie to collect new data sources (in addition to those collected by default).

This tutorial will demonstrate the use of PxL scripts to query telemetry data automatically collected by Pixie.

Pixie comes with many [pre-built PxL scripts](https://github.com/pixie-labs/pixie/tree/main/src/pxl_scripts). These scripts are executed by the Pixie platform using the web-based Live UI, CLI or API.

This tutorial will demonstrate using the Live UI.
