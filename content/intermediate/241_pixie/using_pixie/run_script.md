Let's use Pixie's Live UI to run a built-in PxL script.

### Run a PxL Script

1. Open Pixieâ€™s [Live UI](https://work.withpixie.ai/).
2. Select your cluster using the `cluster` drop-down menu.

3. Select the `px/namespace` script from the `script` drop-down menu.

4. This script has one required argument (as denoted with an `*`). Enter `px-sock-shop` for the `namespace` argument.

After the script executes, you should see a view similar to the following:

![px_namespace](/images/pixie/px_namespace.png)

This script (`px/namespace`) shows:

- A service graph of HTTP1/2 traffic between the pods in the specified namespace.
- A list of the services and pods with high-level resource and application metrics.

This script takes one other argument, `start_time`. This argument is specified as a relative time (e.g. `-30s`, `-30m`, `-1hr`) and provides the time window for the query.
