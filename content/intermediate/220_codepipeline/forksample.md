We are now going to [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the sample Kubernetes service
so that we will be able modify the repository and trigger builds.

Login to GitHub and fork the sample service to your own account:

Once the repo is forked, you can view it in your your [GitHub repositories](https://github.com).

The forked repo will look like:
