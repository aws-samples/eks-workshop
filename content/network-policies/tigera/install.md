Now that your environment variables are set, and _tsctl_ is installed, go back to the instructions in the Tigera Secure CE v1.0.1 download link and look for the second step in the **Procedure** section.  It should look something like this:
```
tsctl install --token $TS_TOKEN \
            --kubeconfig ~/.kube/config \
            --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME \
            --vpc-id $VPC_ID \
            --control-plane-sg $CONTROL_PLANE_SG \
            --node-sgs $K8S_NODE_SGS
```
Copy that text and run it in your Cloud9 shell.

### Known Issues

* It may take up to five seconds for pods to gain network connectivity after starting up.

* Network Load Balancers (NLBs) may lose their ability to balance traffic to pods after installing Tigera Secure CE. To resolve this issue, manually modify the podsâ€™ security group to allow ingress traffic from the original source of the traffic (not the NLB). See the User Guide for more information or contact Tigera support for assistance.
