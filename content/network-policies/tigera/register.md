[Tigera Secure Cloud Edition](https://www.tigera.io/tigera-secure-ce) can be enabled through the [AWS Marketplace].  However, for this workshop, Tigera has enabled a 30 day free trial.  To register for the free trial, please follow the steps below:

- Go to the Tigera Secure Cloud Edition trial registration website at https://ce.tigera.io and click the *register* button.

- On the next page fill in your e-mail and company name and use the code **EKS30** for the access code.

- Wait for a few minutes for a confirmation e-mail to arrive in your inbox.  

- Click on the link in the e-mail and you will be directed to the Tigera support web portal.  Create a new password and log into the Tigera Support web portal (you will automatically be directed there).  You can come back to the [support page](https://support.tigera.io) in the future by using your login and password.

- Once on the support site, you will have an option to *download software*.  Continue to follow the links until you are prompted to Download _Tigera Secure Cloud Edition v1.0.1_.  When you click on that link, you will be presented with a webpage with instructions to install Tigera Secure Cloud Edition on your cluster.  Save that page, as you will need to refer to those instructions in the next step.
