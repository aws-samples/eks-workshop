This example creates a two instance Amazon Elasticsearch cluster named kubernetes-logs. This cluster is created in the same region as the Kubernetes cluster and CloudWatch log group. 

{{% notice warning %}}
Note that this cluster has an open access policy which will need to be locked down in production environments.
{{% /notice %}}

```
aws es create-elasticsearch-domain \
  --domain-name kubernetes-logs \
  --elasticsearch-version 6.3 \
  --elasticsearch-cluster-config \
  InstanceType=m4.large.elasticsearch,InstanceCount=2 \
  --ebs-options EBSEnabled=true,VolumeType=standard,VolumeSize=100 \
  --access-policies '{"Version":"2012-10-17","Statement":[{"Effect":"Allow","Principal":{"AWS":["*"]},"Action":["es:*"],"Resource":"*"}]}'
```

It takes a little while for the cluster to be created and arrive at an active state. The AWS Console should show the following status when the cluster is ready.

You could also check this via AWS CLI:
```
aws es describe-elasticsearch-domain --domain-name kubernetes-logs --query 'DomainStatus.Processing'
```
If the output value is false that means the domain has been processed and is now available to use.

Feel free to move on to the next section for now.
