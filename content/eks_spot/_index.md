In this workshop, you learn how to provision, manage, and maintain your Amazon Kubernetes 
clusters with Amazon EKS at any scale on Spot Instances to architect for optimizations on cost and scale. 
We dive deep using hands-on material to provision and scale worker nodes, handle 
interruptions, and design for fault tolerance.

This workshop is originally based on AWS [EKS Workshop](https://eksworkshop.com/). You can find 
there more modules and learn about other Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service best practices.
