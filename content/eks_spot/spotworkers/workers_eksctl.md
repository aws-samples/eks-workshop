title: "Adding Spot Workers with eksctl"

In this section we will deploy the instance types we selected and request nodegroups that adhere to Spot diversification best practices. For that we will use **[eksctl create nodegroup](https://eksctl.io/usage/managing-nodegroups/)** and eksctl configuration files to add the new nodes to the cluster.

But first, we will add a new label to the OnDemand worker nodes

```bash
kubectl label nodes --all 'lifecycle=OnDemand'
```

```bash
kubectl label nodes --all 'intent=control-apps'
```

Let's create the configuration file:
```
cat <<EoF > ~/environment/spot_nodegroups.yml
apiVersion: eksctl.io/v1alpha5
kind: ClusterConfig
metadata:
    name: eksworkshop-eksctl
    region: $AWS_REGION
nodeGroups:
    - name: dev-4vcpu-16gb-spot
      minSize: 0
      maxSize: 5
      desiredCapacity: 1
      instancesDistribution:
        instanceTypes: ["m5.xlarge", "m5d.xlarge", "m4.xlarge","t3.xlarge","t3a.xlarge","m5a.xlarge","t2.xlarge"] 
        onDemandBaseCapacity: 0
        onDemandPercentageAboveBaseCapacity: 0
        spotAllocationStrategy: capacity-optimized
      labels:
        lifecycle: Ec2Spot
        intent: apps
        aws.amazon.com/spot: "true"
      taints:
        spotInstance: "true:PreferNoSchedule"
      tags:
        k8s.io/cluster-autoscaler/node-template/label/lifecycle: Ec2Spot
        k8s.io/cluster-autoscaler/node-template/label/intent: apps
        k8s.io/cluster-autoscaler/node-template/label/aws.amazon.com/spot: "true"
        k8s.io/cluster-autoscaler/node-template/taint/spotInstance: "true:PreferNoSchedule"
      iam:
        withAddonPolicies:
          autoScaler: true
          cloudWatch: true
          albIngress: true
    - name: dev-8vcpu-32gb-spot
      minSize: 0
      maxSize: 5
      desiredCapacity: 1
      instancesDistribution:
        instanceTypes: ["m5.2xlarge", "m5d.2xlarge", "m4.2xlarge","t3.2xlarge","t3a.2xlarge","m5a.2xlarge","t2.2xlarge"] 
        onDemandBaseCapacity: 0
        onDemandPercentageAboveBaseCapacity: 0
        spotAllocationStrategy: capacity-optimized
      labels:
        lifecycle: Ec2Spot
        intent: apps
        aws.amazon.com/spot: "true"
      taints:
        spotInstance: "true:PreferNoSchedule"
      tags:
        k8s.io/cluster-autoscaler/node-template/label/lifecycle: Ec2Spot
        k8s.io/cluster-autoscaler/node-template/label/intent: apps
        k8s.io/cluster-autoscaler/node-template/label/aws.amazon.com/spot: "true"
        k8s.io/cluster-autoscaler/node-template/taint/spotInstance: "true:PreferNoSchedule"
      iam:
        withAddonPolicies:
          autoScaler: true
          cloudWatch: true
          albIngress: true
EoF
```

This will create a `spot_nodegroups.yml` file that we will use to instruct eksctl to create two nodegroups, both with a diversified configuration.

```
eksctl create nodegroup -f spot_nodegroups.yml
```

{{% notice note %}}
The creation of the workers will take about 3 minutes.
{{% /notice %}}

There are a few things to note in the configuration that we just used to create these nodegroups.

 * We did set up **minSize** to 0, **maxSize** to 5 and **desiredCapacity** to 1. Nodegroups can be scaled down to 0.
 * We did set up **onDemandBaseCapacity** and **onDemandPercentageAboveBaseCapacity** both to **0**. which implies all nodes in the nodegroup would be **Spot instances**.
 * We did set up a **lifecycle: Ec2Spot** label so we can identify Spot nodes and use [affinities](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/) and [nodeSelectors](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#nodeselector) later on.
 * We did specify **spotAllocationStrategy** pointing it to use **[Capacity Optimized](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/08/new-capacity-optimized-allocation-strategy-for-provisioning-amazon-ec2-spot-instances/)**. This will ensure the capacity we provision in our nodegroups is procured from the pools that will have less chances of being interrupted.
 * We did also add an extra label **intent: apps**. We will use this label to force a hard partition
 of the cluster for our applications. During this workshop we will deploy control applications on
 nodes that have been labeled with **intent: control-apps** while our applications get deployed to nodes labeled with **intent: apps**.
 * We are also applying a **[Taint](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/taint-and-toleration/)** using `spotInstance: "true:PreferNoSchedule"`.  **PreferNoSchedule** is used to indicate we prefer pods not be scheduled on Spot Instances. This is a “preference” or “soft” version of **NoSchedule** – the system will try to avoid placing a pod that does not tolerate the taint on the node, but it is not required.
 * We did apply **k8s.io/cluster-autoscaler/node-template/label** and **k8s.io/cluster-autoscaler/node-template/taint** tags to the nodegroups. [This tags are used by cluster autoscaler](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#how-can-i-scale-a-node-group-to-0) when nodegroups scale down to 0. They ensure cluster autoscaler considers tolerations and placement preferences of pending pods on nodegroups of 0 size.  

{{% notice info %}}
If you are wondering at this stage: *Where is spot bidding price ?* you are missing some of the changes EC2 Spot instances had since 2017. Since November 2017 [EC2 Spot price changes infrequently](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/new-amazon-ec2-spot-pricing/) based on long term supply and demand of spare capacity in each pool independently. You can still set up a **maxPrice** in scenarios where you want to set maximum budget. By default *maxPrice* is set to the On-Demand price; Regardless of what the *maxPrice* value, spot instances will still be charged at the current spot market price.

### Confirm the Nodes

{{% notice tip %}}
Aside from familiarizing yourself with the kubectl commands below to obtain the cluster information, you should also explore your cluster using **kube-ops-view** and find out the nodes that were just created.
{{% /notice %}}

Confirm that the new nodes joined the cluster correctly. You should see the nodes added to the cluster.

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

You can use the node-labels to identify the lifecycle of the nodes

```bash
kubectl get nodes --show-labels --selector=lifecycle=Ec2Spot | grep Ec2Spot
```

The output of this command should return **Ec2Spot** nodes. At the end of the node output, you should see the node label **lifecycle=Ec2Spot**

![Spot Output](/images/using_ec2_spot_instances_with_eks/spotworkers/spot_get_spot.png)

Now we will show all nodes with the **lifecycle=OnDemand**. The output of this command should return OnDemand nodes (the ones that we tagged when
creating the cluster).

```bash
kubectl get nodes --show-labels --selector=lifecycle=OnDemand | grep OnDemand
```

![OnDemand Output](/images/using_ec2_spot_instances_with_eks/spotworkers/spot_get_od.png)

You can use the `kubectl describe nodes` with one of the spot nodes to see the taints applied to the EC2 Spot Instances.
