# Conclusion

In this workshop, you learned about the need to be flexible with EC2 instance types when using Spot Instances, applying EC2 Spot diversification best practices on Kubernetes & EKS using [Cluster Autoscaler](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler) and [Horizontal Pod Autoscaler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/).

You can continue your learning path by taking a look at the content and modules available at **[eksworkshop.com](https://eksworkshop.com/)**. Perhaps there are modules that you would like to try on spot instances ! 

Let's wrap up with a summary of what we have accomplished.
