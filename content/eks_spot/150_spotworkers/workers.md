We have our EKS Cluster and worker nodes already, but we need some Spot Instances configured as workers. We also need a Node Labeling strategy to identify which instances are Spot and which are on-demand so that we can make more intelligent scheduling decisions. We will use `eksctl` to launch new worker nodes that will connect to the EKS cluster.

But first, we will add a new label to the OnDemand worker nodes

```bash
kubectl label nodes --all 'lifecycle=OnDemand'
```

#### Create Spot worker nodes

We are now ready to create new worker nodes.

```bash
cat << EoF > ~/environment/eks-workshop-ng-spot.yaml
apiVersion: eksctl.io/v1alpha5
kind: ClusterConfig
metadata:
  name: eksworkshop-eksctl 
  region: ${AWS_REGION}
nodeGroups:
  - name: ng-spot
    labels:
      lifecycle: Ec2Spot
    taints:
      spotInstance: true:PreferNoSchedule
    minSize: 2
    maxSize: 5
    instancesDistribution: 
      instanceTypes:
        - m5.large
        - m4.large
        - m5d.large
        - m5a.large
        - m5ad.large
        - m5n.large
        - m5dn.large
      onDemandBaseCapacity: 0
      onDemandPercentageAboveBaseCapacity: 0 # all the instances will be Spot Instances
      spotAllocationStrategy: capacity-optimized # launch Spot Instances from the most availably Spot Instance pools
EoF

eksctl create nodegroup -f ~/environment/eks-workshop-ng-spot.yaml
```

During the creation of the Node Group, we have configured a **node-label** so that kubernetes knows what type of nodes we have provisioned. We set the **lifecycle** for the nodes as **Ec2Spot**. We are also [tainting](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/taint-and-toleration/) with **PreferNoSchedule** to prefer pods not be scheduled on Spot Instances. This is a “preference” or “soft” version of **NoSchedule** – the system will try to avoid placing a pod that does not tolerate the taint on the node, but it is not required.

Also, we specified [capacity-optimized](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/introducing-the-capacity-optimized-allocation-strategy-for-amazon-ec2-spot-instances/) as the spotAllocationStrategy, which will launch instances from the Spot Instance pools with the most available capacity (out of the instance types we specified), aiming to decrease the number of Spot interruptions in our cluster (when EC2 needs the capacity back).

The creation of the workers will take about 3 minutes.

#### Confirm the Nodes

Confirm that the new nodes joined the cluster correctly. You should see 2 more nodes added to the cluster.

```bash
kubectl get nodes --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp
```

![All Nodes](/images/spotworkers/spot_get_nodes.png)
You can use the node-labels to identify the lifecycle of the nodes.

```bash
kubectl get nodes --label-columns=lifecycle --selector=lifecycle=Ec2Spot
```

The output of this command should return 2 nodes. At the end of the node output, you should see the node label **lifecycle=Ec2Spot**.

![Spot Output](/images/spotworkers/spot_get_spot.png)

Now we will show all nodes with the **lifecycle=OnDemand**. The output of this command should return multiple nodes as configured in `eksctl` YAMl template.

```bash
kubectl get nodes --label-columns=lifecycle --selector=lifecycle=OnDemand
```

You can use the `kubectl describe nodes` with one of the spot nodes to see the taints applied to the EC2 Spot Instances.
