### Running the workshop at an AWS Event

{{% notice warning %}}
Only complete this section if you are at an AWS hosted event (such as re:Invent,
Kubecon, Immersion Day, or any other event hosted by an AWS employee). If you 
are running the workshop on your own, go to: [Start the workshop on your own]({{< relref "self_paced.md" >}}).

### Login to the AWS Workshop Portal

If you are at an AWS event, an AWS account was created for you to use throughout the workshop. You will need the **Participant Hash** provided to you by the event's organizers.

1. Connect to the portal by browsing to [https://dashboard.eventengine.run/](https://dashboard.eventengine.run/).
2. Enter the Hash in the text box, and click **Proceed** 
3. In the User Dashboard screen, click **AWS Console** 
4. In the popup page, click **Open Console** 

You are now logged in to the AWS console in an account that was created for you, and will be available only throughout the workshop run time.

Once you have completed the step above, **you can head straight to [Create a Workspace]({{< relref "workspace.md" >}})**
