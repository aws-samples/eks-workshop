{{% notice note %}}
If you're running in an account that was created for you as part of an AWS event, there's no need to go through the cleanup stage - the account will be closed automatically.\
If you're running in your own account, make sure you run through these steps to make sure you don't encounter unwanted costs.

{{% notice tip %}}
Before you clean up the resources and complete the workshop, you may want to review the complete some of the optional exercises in previous section of this workshop; or alternatively, take a look at the content and modules available at **[eksworkshop.com](https://eksworkshop.com/)**. Perhaps there are modules that you would like to try on EC2 Spot instances!

## Cleaning up HPA, CA, and the Microservice
```
kubectl delete hpa monte-carlo-pi-service
kubectl delete -f ~/environment/cluster-autoscaler/cluster_autoscaler.yml
kubectl delete -f monte-carlo-pi-service.yml
helm delete kube-ops-view metrics-server
```

## Removing eks nodegroups
```
eksctl delete nodegroup -f spot_nodegroups.yml --approve
od_nodegroup=$(eksctl get nodegroup --cluster eksworkshop-eksctl | tail -n 1 | awk '{print $2}')
eksctl delete nodegroup --cluster eksworkshop-eksctl --name $od_nodegroup
```

This operation may take some time. Once that it completes you can proceed with the deletion of the cluster.

If you get any error while running this command, perhaps it might be caused because the name you selected for your cloud9 environment is different from **eksworkshop**. You can either find out and replace the name in the commands with the right name or [Use the console to delete the environment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/delete-environment.html).
