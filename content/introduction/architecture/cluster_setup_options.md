In addition to the managed AWS EKS solution, there are many tools available to help bootstrap and configure a self-managed Kubernetes cluster.  They include:

* [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/minikube/) – Development and Learning
* [Kops](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops) – Learning, Development, Production
* [Kubeadm](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/independent/create-cluster-kubeadm/) – Learning, Development, Production
* [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#kubernetes) - Learning, Development
