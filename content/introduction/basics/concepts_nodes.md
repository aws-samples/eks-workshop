The machines that make up a Kubernetes cluster are called **nodes**.

Nodes in a Kubernetes cluster may be physical, or virtual.  

There are two types of nodes:

* A Master-node type, which makes up the [Control Plane](../../architecture/architecture_control), acts as the “brains” of the cluster.

* A Worker-node type, which makes up the [Data Plane](../../architecture/architecture_worker), runs the actual container images (via pods.)

We’ll dive deeper into how nodes interact with each other later in the presentation.
