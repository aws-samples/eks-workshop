### Kubernetes Jobs

A _job_ creates one or more pods and ensures that a specified number of them successfully terminate. As pods successfully complete, the job tracks the successful completions. When a specified number of successful completions is reached, the job itself is complete. Deleting a Job will cleanup the pods it created.

Save the below manifest as 'job-whalesay.yaml' using your favorite editor.

```
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: whalesay
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: whalesay
        image: docker/whalesay
        command: ["cowsay",  "This is a Kubernetes Job!"]
      restartPolicy: Never
  backoffLimit: 4
```

Run a sample Kubernetes Job using the `whalesay` image.

```
kubectl apply -f job-whalesay.yaml
```

Wait until the job has completed successfully.

```bash
kubectl get job/whalesay
```

```output
NAME       DESIRED   SUCCESSFUL   AGE
whalesay   1         1            2m
```

Confirm the output.

```bash
kubectl logs -l job-name=whalesay
```

```output
