#### Download Prometheus

```sh
curl -o prometheus-values.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/charts/master/stable/prometheus/values.yaml
```

Open the prometheus-values.yaml you downloaded by double clicking on the file name on the left panel.

Search for **# storageClass: "-"** in the prometheus-values.yaml, uncomment and change the value to **"prometheus"**. You will do this twice, under both **`server`** & **`alertmanager`** manifests

The manifests will look like below

```yaml
    ## Prometheus server data Persistent Volume Storage Class
    ## If defined, storageClassName: <storageClass>
    ## If set to "-", storageClassName: "", which disables dynamic provisioning
    ## If undefined (the default) or set to null, no storageClassName spec is
    ##   set, choosing the default provisioner.  (gp2 on AWS, standard on
    ##   GKE, AWS & OpenStack)
    ##
    storageClass: "prometheus"
```

```yaml
    ## alertmanager data Persistent Volume Storage Class
    ## If defined, storageClassName: <storageClass>
    ## If set to "-", storageClassName: "", which disables dynamic provisioning
    ## If undefined (the default) or set to null, no storageClassName spec is
    ##   set, choosing the default provisioner.  (gp2 on AWS, standard on
    ##   GKE, AWS & OpenStack)
    ##
    storageClass: "prometheus"
```

Search for **## List of IP addresses at which the Prometheus server service is available**, add **nodePort: 30900** and change the type to **NodePort** as indicated below. Because Prometheus is exposed as ClusterIP by default, the web UI cannot be reached outside of Kubernetes. The reason we are adding NodePort here is for viewing the web UI from worker node IP address. This configuration is not recommended in Production and there are better ways to secure it. You can read more about exposing Prometheus web UI in this [link](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/blob/master/Documentation/user-guides/exposing-prometheus-and-alertmanager.md)

```yaml
## List of IP addresses at which the Prometheus server service is available
## Ref: https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/services/#external-ips
##
externalIPs: []

loadBalancerIP: ""
loadBalancerSourceRanges: []
servicePort: 80
nodePort: 30900
type: NodePort
```

#### Deploy Prometheus

```sh
helm install -f prometheus-values.yaml stable/prometheus --name prometheus --namespace prometheus
```

Make a note of prometheus endpoint in helm response (you will need this later). It should look similar to below

```text
The Prometheus server can be accessed via port 80 on the following DNS name from within your cluster:
prometheus-server.prometheus.svc.cluster.local
```

Check if Prometheus components deployed as expected

```sh
kubectl get all -n prometheus
```

You should see response similar to below. They should all be Ready and Available

```text

You can access Prometheus server URL by going to any one of your Worker node IP address and specify port **:30900/targets** (for ex, 52.12.161.128:30900/targets. Remember to open port **30900** in your Worker nodes Security Group. In the web UI, you can see all the targets and metrics being monitored by Prometheus
