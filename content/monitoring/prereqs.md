#### Is `helm` installed?

We will use **helm** to install Prometheus & Grafana monitoring tools for this chapter. Please review  [installing helm chapter](/helm_root/helm_intro/install/index.html) for instructions if you don't have it installed.

```
helm ls
```

#### Configure Storage Class

We will use **gp2** EBS volumes for simplicity and demonstration purpose. While deploying in Production, you would use **io1** volumes with desired IOPS and increase the default storage size in the manifests to get better performance.

Save the below manifest as **_prometheus-storageclass.yaml_** using your favorite editor.

#### Challenge:
**You need to update provisioner value that is applicable to AWS EBS provisioner. Please see [Kubernetes documentation] (https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/) for help**

```
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: prometheus
  namespace: prometheus
provisioner: <EDIT: UPDATE WITH VALUE OF EBS PROVISIONER>
parameters:
  type: gp2
reclaimPolicy: Retain
mountOptions:
  - debug
```
{{% expand "Expand here to see the solution"%}}
```yaml
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: prometheus
  namespace: prometheus
provisioner: kubernetes.io/aws-ebs
parameters:
  type: gp2
reclaimPolicy: Retain
mountOptions:
  - debug
```
{{%/expand%}}

#### Challenge:
**Create storageclass "prometheus" by applying proper kubectl command**

{{% expand "Expand here to see the solution"%}}
```
kubectl create -f prometheus-storageclass.yaml
```
{{%/expand%}}
