So far we have walked through setting up CI/CD for EKS using AWS CodePipeline and now we are going to
make a change to the GitHub repository so that we can see a new release built and delivered.

Open [GitHub](https://github.com/) and select the forked repository with the name **eks-workshop-sample-api-service-go**.

Click on **main.go** file and then click on the **edit** button, which looks like a pencil.

Change the text where it says "Hello World", add a commit message and then click the "Commit changes" button.

You should leave the master branch selected.

{{% notice info %}}
The main.go application needs to be compiled, so please ensure that you don't accidentally break the build :)

After you modify and commit your change in GitHub, in approximately one minute you will see a new build triggered in the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codepipeline/pipelines)

Once the service is built and delivered, run the following command to get the Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) endpoint and open it in a browser.
If the message is not updated immediately, give Kubernetes some time to deploy the change.

```
kubectl get services hello-k8s -o wide
```

The EXTERNAL-IP column contains a value that ends with "elb.amazonaws.com" - the full value is the DNS record.
