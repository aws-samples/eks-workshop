#### Update Our Application

So far we have walked through setting up CI/CD for EKS using AWS CodePipeline and now we are going to
make a change to the GitHub repository so that we can see a new release built and delivered.

Open [GitHub](https://github.com/) and select the forked repository with the name **eks-workshop-sample-api-service-go**.

Click on **main.go** file and then click on the **edit** button, which looks like a pencil.

Change the text where it says "Hello World", add a commit message and then click the "Commit changes" button.

You should leave the master branch selected.

{{% notice info %}}
The main.go application needs to be compiled, so please ensure that you don't accidentally break the build :)

![GitHub Modify](/images/codepipeline/github_modify.png)

After you modify and commit your change in GitHub, in approximately one minute you will see a new build triggered in the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codepipeline/pipelines)

#### Confirm the Change

If you still have the ELB URL open in your browser, refresh to confirm the update. If you need to retrieve the URL again, use `kubectl get services hello-k8s -o wide`
