Now we are going to create the AWS CodePipeline using [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/).

CloudFormation is an [infrastructure as code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_Code) (IaC) tool which
provides a common language for you to describe and provision all the infrastructure resources in your cloud environment.
CloudFormation allows you to use a simple text file to model and provision, in an automated and secure manner, all the
resources needed for your applications across all regions and accounts.

Each EKS deployment/service should have its own CodePipeline and be located in an isolated source repository.

You can modify the CloudFormation templates provided with this workshop to meet your system requirements to easily
onboard new services to your EKS cluster. For each new service the following steps can be repeated.

Click the **Launch** button to create the CloudFormation stack in the AWS Management Console.

| Launch template |  |  |
| ------ |:------:|:--------:|
| CodePipeline & EKS |  {{% cf-launch "ci-cd-codepipeline.cfn.yml" "eksws-codepipeline" %}} | {{% cf-download "ci-cd-codepipeline.cfn.yml" %}}  |

After the console is open, enter your GitHub username, personal access token (created in previous step), check the acknowledge box and then click the "Create" button.

Wait for the status to change from "CREATE_IN_PROGRESS" to **CREATE_COMPLETE** before moving on to the next step.

Open [CodePipeline in the Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codepipeline/pipelines). You will see a CodePipeline that starts with **eks-workshop-codepipeline**.

Once you are on the detail page for the specific CodePipeline, you can see the status along with links to the change and build details.

{{% notice tip %}}
If you click on the "details" link in the build/deploy stage, you can see the output from the CodeBuild process.

To review the status of the deployment, you can run:

```
kubectl describe deployment hello-k8s
```

For the status of the service, run the following command:

```
kubectl describe service hello-k8s
```

Once the service is built and delivered, run the following command to get the Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) endpoint and open it in a browser.

```
kubectl get services hello-k8s -o wide
```

{{% notice info %}}
This service was configured with a [LoadBalancer](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/create-external-load-balancer/) so,
an [AWS Elastic Load Balancer](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/) is launched by Kubernetes for the service.
The EXTERNAL-IP column contains a value that ends with "elb.amazonaws.com" - the full value is the DNS address.
