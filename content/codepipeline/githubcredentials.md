In order for CodePipeline to receive callbacks from GitHub, we need to generate a personal access token.

Once created, an access token can be stored in a secure enclave and reused, so this step is only required
during the first run or when you need to generate new keys.

Open up the [New personal access page](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) in GitHub.

Enter a value for **Token description**, check the **repo** permission scope and scroll down and click the **Generate token** button

Copy the **personal access token** and save it in a secure place for the next step
