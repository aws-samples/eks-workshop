# Deploying Stateful Microservices with Amazon FSx Lustre

{{< youtube ttCAqwnN_Qo >}}

Amazon FSx for Lustre is a fully managed service that provides cost-effective, high-performance storage for compute workloads. Many workloads such as machine learning, high performance computing (HPC), video rendering, and financial simulations depend on compute instances accessing the same set of data through high-performance shared storage.

Powered by Lustre, the world's most popular high-performance file system, FSx for Lustre offers sub-millisecond latencies, up to hundreds of gigabytes per second of throughput, and millions of IOPS. It provides multiple deployment options and storage types to optimize cost and performance for your workload requirements.

FSx for Lustre file systems can also be linked to Amazon S3 buckets, allowing you to access and process data concurrently from both a high-performance file system and from the S3 API.
