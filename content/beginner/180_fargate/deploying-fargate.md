#### Deploying Pods to Fargate

Deploy the game [2048](https://play2048.co/) as a sample application to verify that the ALB Ingress Controller creates an Application Load Balancer as a result of the Ingress object.

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-alb-ingress-controller/${ALB_INGRESS_VERSION}/docs/examples/2048/2048-namespace.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-alb-ingress-controller/${ALB_INGRESS_VERSION}/docs/examples/2048/2048-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-alb-ingress-controller/${ALB_INGRESS_VERSION}/docs/examples/2048/2048-service.yaml
```

You can check if a Deployment has completed

```bash
kubectl -n 2048-game rollout status deployment 2048-deployment
```

Output:
{{< output >}}
Waiting for deployment "2048-deployment" rollout to finish: 0 of 5 updated replicas are available...
Waiting for deployment "2048-deployment" rollout to finish: 1 of 5 updated replicas are available...
Waiting for deployment "2048-deployment" rollout to finish: 2 of 5 updated replicas are available...
Waiting for deployment "2048-deployment" rollout to finish: 3 of 5 updated replicas are available...
Waiting for deployment "2048-deployment" rollout to finish: 4 of 5 updated replicas are available...
deployment "2048-deployment" successfully rolled out

Next, run the following command to list all the nodes in the EKS cluster and you should see output as follows:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

Output:
{{< output >}}

If your cluster has any worker nodes, they will be listed with a name starting wit the **ip-** prefix. In addition to the worker nodes, if any, there will now be five additional “fargate” nodes listed. These are merely kubelets from the microVMs in which your sample app pods are running under Fargate, posing as nodes to the EKS Control Plane. This is how the EKS Control Plane stays aware of the Fargate infrastructure under which the pods it orchestrates are running. There will be a “fargate” node added to the cluster for each pod deployed on Fargate.
