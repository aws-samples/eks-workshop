### Getting Started 

Before you go any further, please remember to type lab2 set_up in the terminal to set up the environment for this lab.

### Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how Calico Enterprise makes it easy for platform engineering and development teams to gain visibility into everything that is happening from a networking perspective within your cluster, quickly diagnose issues, and understand how policies are being evaluated in real-time. The visibility that Calico Enterprise provides is a cornerstone to improving the operations of your container platform and adopting network security best practices.

You will learn the following:

   - How to use the Flow Visualizer to gain visibility into existing traffic flows within the cluster and quickly identify sources of denied traffic
   - How to use the Policy Board and Policy Editor to understand how policies are being evaluated in real-time across Policy Tiers
   - How to use network Flow Logs to look “under the hood” of your cluster and get a detailed view into how workloads are communicating with all of Kubernetes context to troubleshoot and diagnose issues
