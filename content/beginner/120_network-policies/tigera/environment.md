### Getting Started 
  
  Before you go any further, please remember to type `lab1 set_up` in the terminal to set up the environment for this lab.

### Introduction

  In this lab, you will learn to leverage Calico Enterprise to implement pod-level access controls and enable a self-service model that makes it easy for development teams to define and deploy Calico and Kubernetes network policies for their applications. This allows your organization to more easily adopt best practices around microsegmentation and a zero-trust approach to network security in your Kubernetes platform.

### You will learn the following:

   - How to use Policy Tiers and Network Sets to define network policies that define the “guard rails” for your entire Kubernetes platform
   - How to use DNS policy rules to enable external access for applications in specific namespaces
   - How to use the Flow Visualizer to gain visibility into existing traffic flows within the cluster and select workloads to recommend policies using Policy Recommendations
   - How to use Policy Impact Preview and Staged Network Policies to evaluate the impact of new network policies and changes to existing policies before they are enforced within the cluster
