The team at Tigera offers a free access to [Calico Enterprise Edition](https://www.tigera.io/tigera-products/calico-enterprise) for all EKSWorkshop users. Follow the steps below to get your free trial to access Calico Enterprise and run it directly on your EKS cluster.

- Go to the Calico Enterprise trial registration website using [this](https://www.tigera.io/tigera-products/enterprise-trial) link . 

- Fill out your contact details along with your work email address to ensure you receive your trial environment details promptly.

- Select Amazon EKS as your Kubernetes distro. 

- For the Promo Code, please use **PAR-AWS-EKS-WORKSHOP**. It is critical for you to use this code as it is used to automatically approve trial requests for EKS Workshop Users.

- Review and accept the terms of service and click the START YOUR TRIAL button.

- Somebody from the Tigera team will provision your environment and send you an email with the details you need. This is currently a manual process and can take up to half an hour during business hours M-F 9 am - 5 pm PT. Requests received during non-business hours will be provisioned on the next business day.

- Once you receive the email titled "Your Calico Enterprise Trial Credentials" from cet@tigera.io ( make sure it's not going to your spam folder). You will be supplied with a single command to run against your existing EKS cluster. This command will automatically install the required Calico Enterprise components on your EKS cluster so you will be able to use a dedicated management portal to manage this cluster.

- You may follow the instructions provided in the email to register your EKS cluster and go through the advanced labs!
