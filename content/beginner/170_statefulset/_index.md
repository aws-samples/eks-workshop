# Stateful containers using StatefulSets

[StatefulSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/) manages the deployment and scaling of a set of Pods, and provides guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of these Pods, suitable for applications that require one or more of the following.

* Stable, unique network identifiers
* Stable, persistent storage
* Ordered, graceful deployment and scaling
* Ordered, automated rolling updates

In this Chapter, we will review how to deploy a MySQL database using `StatefulSet` and `Amazon Elastic Block Store` (EBS) as [PersistentVolume](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/). The example is a MySQL single leader topology with a follower running asynchronous replication.
