## Unhealthy container

MySQL container uses readiness probe by running mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -e 'SELECT 1' on the server to make sure MySQL server is still active.
Open a new terminal and simulate MySQL as being unresponsive by following command.

```sh
kubectl -n mysql exec mysql-1 -c mysql -- mv /usr/bin/mysql /usr/bin/mysql.off
```

This command renames the /usr/bin/mysql command so that readiness probe can't find it. During the next health check, the pod should report one of it's containers is not healthy. This can be verified by following command.

```sh
kubectl -n mysql get pod mysql-1
```

{{< output >}}
NAME      READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
mysql-1   1/2       Running   0          12m
{{< /output >}}

**mysql-read** load balancer detects failures and takes action by not sending traffic to the failed container, `@@server_id 101`. You can check this by the loop running in the separate window from previous section. The loop shows the following output.
{{< output >}}
+-------------+---------------------+
| @@server_id | NOW()               |
+-------------+---------------------+
|         100 | 2020-01-25 17:32:19 |
+-------------+---------------------+
+-------------+---------------------+
| @@server_id | NOW()               |
+-------------+---------------------+
|         100 | 2020-01-25 17:32:20 |
+-------------+---------------------+
+-------------+---------------------+
| @@server_id | NOW()               |

{{< /output >}}

Revert back to its initial state at the previous terminal.

```sh
kubectl -n mysql exec mysql-1 -c mysql -- mv /usr/bin/mysql.off /usr/bin/mysql
```

Check the status again to see that both containers are running and healthy

```sh
kubectl -n mysql get pod mysql-1
```

{{< output >}}
NAME      READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
mysql-1   2/2       Running   0          5h
{{< /output >}}

The loop in another terminal is now showing `@@server_id 101` is back and all three servers are running.

## Failed pod

To simulate a failed pod, delete mysql-1 pod by following command.

```sh
kubectl -n mysql delete pod mysql-1
```

{{< output >}}
pod "mysql-1" deleted
{{< /output >}}

StatefulSet controller recognizes failed pod and creates a new one to maintain the number of replicas with the same name and link to the same `PersistentVolumeClaim`.

```sh
kubectl -n mysql get pod mysql-1 -w
```

{{< output >}}
NAME      READY   STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
mysql-1   2/2     Terminating   0          15m
mysql-1   0/2     Terminating   0          16m
mysql-1   0/2     Terminating   0          16m
