To remove all the objects that the Helm Chart created, we can use [Helm
uninstall](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_uninstall/).

Before we uninstall our application, we can verify what we have running via the
[Helm list](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_list/) command:

```sh
helm list
```

You should see output similar to below, which show that mywebserver is installed:
{{< output >}}
NAME            NAMESPACE       REVISION        UPDATED                                 STATUS          CHART           APP VERSION
mywebserver     default         1               2021-07-15 13:52:34.563653342 +0000 UTC deployed        nginx-9.3.7     1.21.1   
{{< /output >}}

It was a lot of fun; we had some great times sending HTTP back and forth, but now its time to uninstall this deployment.  To uninstall:

```sh
helm uninstall mywebserver
```

And you should be met with the output:
{{< output >}}
release "mywebserver" uninstalled
{{< /output >}}

kubectl will also demonstrate that our pods and service are no longer available:

```sh
kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name=nginx
kubectl get service mywebserver-nginx -o wide
```

As would trying to access the service via the web browser via a page reload.

With that, cleanup is complete.
