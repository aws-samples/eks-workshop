# Kubernetes Helm

{{% notice note %}}
This tutorial has been updated for Helm V3
{{% /notice %}}


[Helm](https://helm.sh/) is a package manager for Kubernetes that packages multiple Kubernetes resources into a single logical deployment unit called **Chart**. Charts are easy to create, version, share, and publish.

In this chapter, we'll cover [installing Helm](helm_intro).  Once installed, we'll demonstrate how Helm can be used to [deploy a simple NGINX webserver](helm_nginx), and a more [sophisticated microservice](helm_micro).
