Before we bring up the frontend service, let's take a look at the service types
we are using:
This is `kubernetes/service.yaml` for our frontend service:
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: ecsdemo-frontend
spec:
  selector:
    app: ecsdemo-frontend
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
   -  protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 3000
```
Notice `type: LoadBalancer`: This will configure an ELB to handle incoming traffic
to this service.

Compare this to `kubernetes/service.yaml` for one of our backend services:
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: ecsdemo-nodejs
spec:
  selector:
    app: ecsdemo-nodejs
  ports:
   -  protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 3000
```
Notice there is no specific service type described. When we check [the kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types)
we find that the default type is `ClusterIP`. This Exposes the service on a cluster-internal IP.
Choosing this value makes the service only reachable from within the cluster.
