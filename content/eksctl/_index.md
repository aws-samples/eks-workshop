# Launch using [eksctl](https://eksctl.io/)

Because EKS uses AWS CloudFormation and AWS APIs, it is possible to automate much of
the experience of creating an EKS cluster.

In this module, we will highlight a tool jointly developed by AWS and [Weaveworks](https://weave.works)
called [eksctl](https://eksctl.io), based on the official AWS CloudFormation templates,
and will use it to launch and configure our EKS cluster and nodes.
