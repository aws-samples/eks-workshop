Before we can get started configuring Istio weâ€™ll need to first install the command line tools that you will interact with. To do this run the following.

```
cd ~/environment

curl -L https://git.io/getLatestIstio | sh -

// version can be different as istio gets upgraded
cd istio-1.0.3

sudo mv -v bin/istioctl /usr/local/bin/
```
