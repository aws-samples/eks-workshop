# Deploy Example Microservices Using Helm

In this chapter, we will demonstrate how to deploy microservices using a custom Helm Chart, instead of doing everything manually using `kubectl`.

For detailed information on working with chart templates, refer to the [**Helm docs**](https://docs.helm.sh/chart_template_guide/)
