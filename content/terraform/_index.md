# Launch using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)

We also have some very powerful partner tools that allow us to automate much of
the experience of creating an EKS cluster, simplifying the process.

In this module, we will highlight a community created [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) module, and use
it to launch and configure our EKS cluster and nodes.
