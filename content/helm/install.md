Before we can get started configuring `helm` we'll need to first install the
command line tools that you will interact with. To do this run the following.

```
cd ~/environment

curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/helm/master/scripts/get > get_helm.sh

chmod +x get_helm.sh

./get_helm.sh
```
