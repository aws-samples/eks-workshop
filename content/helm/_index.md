# Deploy Helm

In this Chapter, we will deploy [Helm](https://helm.sh/) the Kubernetes Package Manager.

[Helm](https://helm.sh/) is a tool for managing Kubernetes charts. Charts are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources.

[Helm](https://helm.sh/) is a tool that streamlines installing and managing Kubernetes applications. Think of it like apt/yum/homebrew for Kubernetes.
