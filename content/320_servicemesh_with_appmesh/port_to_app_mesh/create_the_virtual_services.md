The next step is to create the two App Mesh Virtual Services that will intercept and route requests made to jazz and metal.

To accomplish this, execute the following command:

```
kubectl apply -nprod -f 4_create_initial_mesh_components/virtual-services.yaml
```

Output should be similar to:

```
virtualservice.appmesh.k8s.aws/jazz.prod.svc.cluster.local created
virtualservice.appmesh.k8s.aws/metal.prod.svc.cluster.local created
```

If we inspect the YAML we just applied, we'll see that we've created two VirtualService resources, where requests made to jazz.prod.svc.cluster.local (via the placeholder service IP of 10.100.220.118) will be intercepted by App Mesh, and routed to the Virtual Node jazz-v1.

Similarly, requests made to metal.prod.svc.cluster.local (via the placeholder service IP of 10.100.122.192) will be routed to the Virtual Node metal-v1:

```
apiVersion: appmesh.k8s.aws/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: jazz.prod.svc.cluster.local
  namespace: prod
spec:
  meshName: dj-app
  virtualRouter:
    name: jazz-router
  routes:
    - name: jazz-route
      http:
        match:
          prefix: /
        action:
          weightedTargets:
            - virtualNodeName: jazz-v1
              weight: 100

apiVersion: appmesh.k8s.aws/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: metal.prod.svc.cluster.local
  namespace: prod
spec:
  meshName: dj-app
  virtualRouter:
    name: metal-router
  routes:
    - name: metal-route
      http:
        match:
          prefix: /
        action:
          weightedTargets:
            - virtualNodeName: metal-v1
              weight: 100
```

Remember to use fully qualified DNS names for the the Virtual Service's metadata.name field to prevent the chance of name collisions when using App Mesh cross-cluster.

With these Virtual Services defined, to access them by name, clients (in our case, the dj container) will first perform a DNS lookup request to  jazz.prod.svc.cluster.local, or metal.prod.svc.cluster.local before making the request.

If the dj container (or any other client) cannot resolve that name to an IP, the subsequent HTTP request will fail with a name lookup error.

Our other physical services (jazz-v1, metal-v1, dj) are defined as physical kubernetes services, and therefore have discoverable names and IPs.  However, these Virtual Services don't (yet).

```
kubectl get svc -nprod
```

yields:

```
NAME       TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
dj         ClusterIP   10.100.247.180   <none>        9080/TCP   16h
jazz-v1    ClusterIP   10.100.157.174   <none>        9080/TCP   16h
metal-v1   ClusterIP   10.100.187.186   <none>        9080/TCP   16h
```

To provide the the jazz and metal virtual services with resolvable IPs and hostnames, we'll define them as kubernetes services that do not map to any deployments or pods;   we'll do this by creating them as k8s services [without defining selectors](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#services-without-selectors) for them.   

Since App Mesh will be intercepting and routing requests made for them, they won't need to map to any pods or deployments on the k8s-side.

To register the placeholder names and IPs for these Virtual Services, execute the following:

```
kubectl create -nprod -f 4_create_initial_mesh_components/metal_and_jazz_placeholder_services.yaml
```

Output should be similar to:

```
service/jazz created
service/metal created
```

We can now use kubectl to get the registered metal and jazz Virtual Services:

```
kubectl get -nprod virtualservices
```

yields:

```
NAME                           AGE
jazz.prod.svc.cluster.local    10m
metal.prod.svc.cluster.local   10m
```

along with the Virtual Service placeholder IPs, and physical service IPs:

```
kubectl get svc -nprod
```

yields:

```
NAME       TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
dj         ClusterIP   10.100.247.180   <none>        9080/TCP   17h
jazz       ClusterIP   10.100.220.118   <none>        9080/TCP   27s
jazz-v1    ClusterIP   10.100.157.174   <none>        9080/TCP   17h
metal      ClusterIP   10.100.122.192   <none>        9080/TCP   27s
metal-v1   ClusterIP   10.100.187.186   <none>        9080/TCP   17h
```

As such, when name lookup requests are made to our Virtual Services, alongside their physical service counterparts, they will resolve.
