#### What is Logs Insights?

[CloudWatch Logs Insights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/AnalyzingLogData.html) is a fully integrated, interactive, and pay-as-you-go log analytics service for CloudWatch. CloudWatch Logs Insights enables you to explore, analyze, and visualize your logs instantly, allowing you to troubleshoot operational problems with ease.

#### Querying Logs from EKS

Navigate to [CloudWatch Logs Insights](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home#logs-insights:) and select **aws/containerinsights/eksworkshop-eksctl/performance** Log Group as shown below

Copy and paste the following query into the textbox and click **Run query**

```
fields kubernetes.pod_name, kubernetes.host
| stats count_distinct(kubernetes.pod_name) as Number_of_Pods by kubernetes.host  
```

This query will return the table that contains the number of Pods that are running on each EKS worker node.

-----------------------------

You can also apply filters to the query as shown below

```
fields kubernetes.pod_name, kubernetes.host
| filter kubernetes.pod_name like 'ecsdemo'
| stats count_distinct(kubernetes.pod_name) as Number_of_Pods by kubernetes.host  
```

The above query will filter the pods with name containing the string **ecsdemo**. Your output should look similar to the one shown below.

---------------------

The following query shows the amount of data (in KB) received and sent by the **ecsdemo-frontend** pod every 5 minutes

```
fields kubernetes.pod_name, pod_interface_network_rx_bytes, pod_interface_network_tx_bytes
| filter kubernetes.pod_name like 'ecsdemo-frontend'
| filter (pod_interface_network_rx_bytes)  > 0
| stats sum(pod_interface_network_rx_bytes/1024) as KB_received, sum(pod_interface_network_tx_bytes/1024) as KB_sent  by bin(5m)
| sort by Timestamp
| limit 100
```
Your result should look similar to the one shown below

You could also switch to the **Visualization** tab to see the data plotted on a timeseries graph as shown below

You can add the visualization to a CloudWatch Dashboard by clicking on **Actions** and selecting **Add to Dashboard** and following the steps in the wizard.

### Creating custom Dashboards

You can easily create a custom dashboard with various types of widgets. Follow the instructions below to create a custom dashboard.

{{% notice info %}}
The AWS region is set to us-west-2, if your Container Insights metrics are in a region other than us-west-2, replace "us-west-2" with the appropriate region
{{% /notice  %}}

* Login to the Amazon CloudWatch Console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=us-west-2#dashboards:
* Click on the **Create dashboard** button
* Enter a new **Dashboard name** (e.g., k8s-HealthDashboard_MyClusterName)
* Click the Create button
* Click the Cancel link
* Click on the **Actions** button
* Select the **View/edit source** menu item
* Copy the content of the JSON below and paste to replace the entire content of the text area
* Click the **Update** button

{{% notice info %}}
If you did not name your cluster as **eksworkshop-eksctl**, make sure you replace all the instances of **"eksworkshop-eksctl"** to the name of your cluster in the json below
{{% /notice  %}}
